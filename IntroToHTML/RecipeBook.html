        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).<br>
<strong>Step 2:</strong>Place trimmed Brussels sprouts, olive oil, kosher salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal tightly, and shake to coat. Pour onto a baking sheet, and place on center oven rack.<br>
<strong>Step 3:</strong>Roast in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, shaking pan every 5 to 7 minutes for even browning. Reduce heat when necessary to prevent burning. Brussels sprouts should be darkest brown, almost black, when done. Adjust seasoning with kosher salt, if necessary. Serve immediately.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Prepare 10-12 skewers. If using wood skewers, be sure to soak them in water for at least one hour before use. In a bowl, mix together the spices to make a spice rub for the cubed meat. <br><strong>Step 2:</strong>Season the cubed meat with the spice rub, combine well so that the meat is evenly covered with the spice rub.<br><strong>Step 3:</strong>In a large and deep dish, combine the marinade ingredients of red onions, lemon juice, olive oil and red wine.<br><strong>Step 4:</strong>Add the spiced cubed meat to the marinade, and work the meat into the marinade well with your hands. Cover and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight.<br><strong>Step 5:</strong>Remove the meat from the fridge one hour before grilling. Lightly oil a gas grill and heat for 10 minutes on high.
        <br><strong>Step 5:</strong>Remove the meat from the marinade and begin to prepare the shish kabobs. Do not discard the marinade yet. Thread the meat, onions, green peppers and red peppers onto the prepared skewers, alternating until you run out of meat (about 4 pieces of meat per skewer with the vegetables nestled in between). Season with more freshly ground black pepper.
 <br><strong>Step 5:</strong>Place the shish kabobs on the heated grill. For medium kabobs, grill for a total of 8 minutes, turning once midway through. While grilling, paint the meat with some of the marinade a couple of times. Transfer to a serving platter and let sit for 5 minutes before serving. Enjoy (See the suggested sides and salads to serve along!)
